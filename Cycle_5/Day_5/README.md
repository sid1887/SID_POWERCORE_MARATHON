# Cycle 5 — Day 5 — Linear Equations & Matrix Applications

## 📘 Domain
Engineering Mathematics for ECE

## 🎯 Topics Covered
- System of linear equations (2 & 3 variables)
- Constraints interpretation of linear equations
- Graphical solutions and intuition
- Cramer’s Rule (determinant method)
- Matrix formulation: AX = B
- Gaussian elimination (row echelon form)
- Gauss–Jordan elimination (RREF)
- Matrix inversion using Gauss–Jordan
- Consistency and uniqueness of solutions
- Homogeneous vs non-homogeneous systems
- Engineering applications (circuits, mechanics)

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Linear equations act as constraints reducing solution space
- Graphical methods are for intuition, not computation
- Determinant ≠ 0 guarantees uniqueness
- Gaussian elimination is the practical solver
- Gauss–Jordan gives direct solutions and matrix inverse
- Homogeneous systems describe natural behavior
- Non-homogeneous systems represent forced response

## ⚠️ Important Conditions
- det(A) = 0 → no or infinite solutions
- Rank analysis classifies system behavior
- Inverse exists iff equations are independent

## 🔗 Cross-Domain Links
- ECE: Nodal & mesh analysis
- VHDL: Parallel equation solvers (theoretical)
- Quantum: Eigenvalue and state-space problems
- Embedded: Firmware-based linear solvers
- Python: NumPy linear algebra (`linalg.solve`)
