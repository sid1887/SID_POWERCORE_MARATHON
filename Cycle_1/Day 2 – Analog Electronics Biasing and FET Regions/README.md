# ⚙️ Cycle 1 – Day 2 | Analog Electronics & Semiconductor Devices

**Date:** Nov 7 2025
**Focus:** BJT Biasing • Load Line Analysis • Q-Point Interpretation • FET Operation

---

## 🧩 Core Concepts
- Derived and visualized the DC load line for a BJT using VCC = 10 V, RC = 2 kΩ.
- Computed Q-point ( VCE = 0.7 V, IC = 4.65 mA ) and learned its role in mode selection.
- Compared **BJT Active vs Saturation** and **FET Linear vs Saturation** regions.
- Understood how RB and RC shift Q-point position along the load line.
- Explored **thermal stability** via emitter resistor feedback.
- Visualized graphical differences between BJT and FET I–V curves.
