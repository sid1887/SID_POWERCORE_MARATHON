# ⚙️ Cycle 1 – Day 3 | Applied Logic & Quantum Crossover
**Date:** Nov 8 2025
**Theme:** From Classical Logic → Reversible Logic → Quantum Thinking

---

## 🧩 Core Focus
- Understanding **reversible computation** and why classical gates lose information.
- Implementing **Toffoli** and **Fredkin** gates in Verilog — bridges between classical and quantum logic.
- Exploring how **information conservation** links ECE to **quantum physics.**
- Visualizing **Bloch spheres** and **layered hardware stacks** connecting electronics to quantum systems.

## 🧠 Concept Summary
| Topic | Key Idea |
|-------|-----------|
| **Irreversible vs Reversible Logic** | Irreversible gates (AND, OR) lose info; reversible gates (Toffoli, Fredkin) preserve it. |
| **Energy & Information** | Destroying bits → heat (Landauer’s principle). Reversible gates theoretically dissipate 0 energy. |
| **Quantum Connection** | Quantum evolution is inherently reversible; every quantum gate can “run backward.” |
| **Hardware Insight** | Superconducting loops, trapped ions, photons, and spins are physical carriers of qubits. |
