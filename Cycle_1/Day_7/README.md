Cycle 1 — Day 7 | Weekly Revision & Testing

Date: 16 Nov 2025
Focus: Consolidation of the entire week (Digital + Verilog + Quantum + Instruments + Communication + Logic Skills)

🧠 What Was Revised

Combinational ALU (arithmetic, logic ops, flags, zero logic)

Sequential ALU (registers, posedge behavior, non-blocking assignments)

Reversible logic concepts (Toffoli, Fredkin)

PWM generation (duty cycle, counters, parameterized width)

Communication basics (Baseband vs Passband, AM/PM/QPSK intuition)

Majority logic, comparator, BCD counter

CRO fundamentals (electron gun, deflection plates, timebase, triggering)

📘 ECET/GATE/Govt-Level Questions Attempted

(These will increase in complexity every week)

Identify reversible vs irreversible gates

Determine active region conditions for BJT

Baseband vs passband identification questions

BCD counter rollover logic

Waveform-based triggering identification

PWM ON-time calculation

Majority logic truth tables

Counter timing calculations

🧩 Interview Simulation

Explained: “Why non-blocking assignments in sequential logic?”

Explained: “Why reversible logic avoids heat dissipation?”

Explained: “Difference between CRO and DSO?”
