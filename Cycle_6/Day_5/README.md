# Cycle 6 — Day 5 — Mechanics + Quantum Coding

## 📘 Domains
- ECE (Mechanics – ECET Core)
- Quantum Computing (Qiskit)
- Python (Scientific Computing)

## 🎯 ECET Topics Covered (50%)
- Kinematics: displacement, velocity, acceleration
- Equations of motion (constant acceleration)
- Vertical motion & free fall
- Projectile motion: time of flight, range, max height
- Angle optimization (45° condition)
- Friction: static vs kinetic
- Direction of friction (motion vs tendency)
- Coefficient of friction
- Angle of repose
- Inclined plane problems with friction

## 🧠 Key ECET Learnings
- Correct sign convention is critical in kinematics
- Projectile motion must be split into horizontal and vertical components
- Maximum range occurs at 45°
- Static friction is self-adjusting up to a maximum value
- Friction acts opposite to relative or impending motion
- Angle of repose directly gives coefficient of friction (μ = tanθ)

## 💻 Python (Quantum + VLSI Track – 30%)
- Implemented projectile motion calculations
- Used math module for trigonometric handling
- Reinforced physics formulas through code

## ⚛️ Quantum (Qiskit – 30%)
- Built a 1-qubit quantum circuit
- Applied Hadamard gate to create superposition
- Performed measurement and analyzed probabilistic outcomes
- Observed effect of shots on measurement statistics

## 📌 Notes
- Embedded/IoT intentionally skipped to maintain focus balance
- Coding used to reinforce intuition, not replace theory
