# Cycle 6 — Day 20 — Python Control Flow & Logic Programming

## 📘 Domain
- Python Programming (Logic & Structure)

## 🎯 Focus
- Writing correct, readable, logic-heavy Python code
- Strengthening control flow and state-based reasoning

## 🧠 Topics Practiced
- Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- Boolean logic and truthiness
- Comparison operators and chained comparisons
- Loops (for, while)
- Break and continue usage
- Function design and responsibility
- Returning values vs printing
- State tracking in loops
- Dictionary and list-based data structures

## 💻 Core Programming Tasks
- FizzBuzz (logic ordering and condition compression)
- Conditional iteration with exclusion rules
- Prime checking using functions
- Sentence analysis (words, vowels, digits)
- Intelligent log analyzer:
  - Parsing structured text input
  - Severity counting (INFO / WARNING / ERROR)
  - Detecting repeated error patterns
  - State-based detection of critical failures

## 🔑 Key Learnings
- Condition order matters more than nesting
- Functions should compute and return, not handle I/O
- Many real problems require state tracking, not counting
- Clean logic beats clever but messy code
- Pythonic solutions reduce bugs and improve clarity

## 📌 Notes
- Theory intentionally skipped
- Focus was on implementation and correction
- Logic debugging was the main learning outcome
