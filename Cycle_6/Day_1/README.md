# Cycle 6 — Day 15 — Units, Dimensions & Measurements

## 📘 Domain
- ECE (Engineering Physics / Measurements)

## 🎯 Topics Covered
- Fundamental and derived physical quantities
- SI base units and derived units
- Advantages of SI system
- Dimensions and dimensional formulae
- Principle of dimensional homogeneity
- Applications of dimensional analysis
- Measurement instruments and least count
- Accuracy vs precision
- Significant figures and rounding rules
- Errors: absolute, relative, percentage
- Error propagation in calculations
- Measurement uncertainty and reporting

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Dimensions describe physical composition, not geometry
- Valid physical equations must be dimensionally homogeneous
- Dimensional analysis is a powerful verification tool but cannot find constants
- Accuracy, precision, and least count represent different measurement qualities
- Significant figures enforce honest reporting of measurements
- Errors propagate differently based on mathematical operations
- Measurement uncertainty defines confidence, not exactness
