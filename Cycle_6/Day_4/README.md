# Cycle 6 — Day 4 — Arduino Ecosystem & ESP32 Essentials

## 📘 Domain
- Embedded Systems (Supporting / Others Category)

## 🎯 Topics Covered
- Arduino board families: Uno, Nano, Mega, Leonardo, Due
- Official vs clone Arduino boards
- AVR vs ARM microcontroller architectures
- Power supply domains: 5V vs 3.3V
- GPIO pin modes, logic levels, and current limits
- ADC fundamentals (resolution, reference voltage, SAR ADC)
- PWM basics and duty cycle control
- Serial communication interfaces: UART, I2C, SPI
- ESP32 overview: dual-core, wireless, GPIO flexibility
- Clock sources and timing importance
- Memory types: Flash, RAM, EEPROM

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Arduino boards differ mainly in architecture, voltage, and I/O
- Clone boards are functionally equivalent for learning
- AVR is simple and educational; ARM is modern and powerful
- Voltage mismatch (5V vs 3.3V) can permanently damage hardware
- GPIO pins have strict current and voltage limits
- Arduino and ESP32 use SAR ADCs with different quality levels
- PWM is digital switching, not true analog output
- UART, I2C, and SPI serve different communication needs
- ESP32 provides performance and connectivity at the cost of complexity
- Clock accuracy affects timing, communication, and correctness
- Flash stores code, RAM stores runtime data, EEPROM stores small persistent data

## 📌 Scope Note
This session was intentionally kept lightweight as Embedded Systems are a supporting skill (Others – 20% focus). No IoT deep dive was done.
