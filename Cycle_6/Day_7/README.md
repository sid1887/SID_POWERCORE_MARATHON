# Cycle 6 — Day 7 — Recap + Quantum Computing Foundations

## 📘 Domains
- Quantum Computing (Foundations + Qiskit)
- Python (supporting tool)
- ECE (theory recap)

## 🎯 Focus Split
- ECET Core (recap only)
- Quantum Theory + Qiskit (primary for the day)
- Tools as intuition builders, not replacements for theory

## 🔁 Recap Highlights
- Reinforced importance of ECET fundamentals as the anchor
- Clarified the role of tools vs theory in long-term learning
- Reset priorities using the 50–30–20 rule

## ⚛️ Quantum Learning (Main Focus)
- What a qubit actually represents (state, not value)
- Difference between classical change and quantum state evolution
- Quantum gates as rotations of state vectors
- Measurement as irreversible collapse
- Bloch sphere as a visual map of single-qubit states

## 💻 Qiskit Hands-on
- Built single-qubit circuits
- Applied X, H, and RY gates
- Observed deterministic vs probabilistic outcomes
- Connected gate operations to Bloch sphere movement
- Understood how probabilities are engineered, not random

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Qiskit is a bridge, not the foundation
- Quantum intuition grows through repeated gentle exposure
- Tools make theory tangible but never replace it
