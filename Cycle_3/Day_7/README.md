🧠 What We Covered (Condensed)
🔹 Day 1 — Quick Digital Recap

Ripple-carry adder, CLA concepts

Clean Verilog structure recall

Small reasoning refresh (propagation logic, full-adder carry flow)

🔹 Day 2 — Analog Intuition (Light)

Voltage gain basics

Why bandwidth shrinks when gain increases

Miller effect (intro)

Transistor small-signal recall

Very minimal theory due to exams, but momentum retained

🔹 Day 3 — Signals & Communication (Short Session)

Short continuation of passband/baseband discussion

Logic skills (two warm-up LS questions)

Quick modulation recap

No Verilog drill due to limited time

🧩 Files Written This Week

Even in a tight week, you wrote:

full_adder.v

ripple_carry_adder.v

cla_4bit.v

(These maintain the coding streak 🔥)

📝 Reflection (Short)

Not the best week — academic pressure + disrupted schedule.

But you did not break the chain.

Even minimal continuity keeps the neural circuits warm.

Cycle 4 will restart stronger after exams.

🔗 Next Cycle (After Exams)

Resume normal PowerCore structure

Full-length Fusion-AG explanations

Daily micro-drills + proper Verilog sessions

Weekly GNN packs back to normal
