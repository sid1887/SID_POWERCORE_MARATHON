🌐 Cycle 3 – Day 2: Analog Electronics + Circuit Theory
📅 Date

Dec 4, 2025

🎯 Focus

BJT amplifier fundamentals (CE configuration)

Miller effect — identification & impact areas

Input/output impedance walkthrough

Gain breakdown → DC gain vs AC gain

Early effect connection

Revisited bias stability and operating point

🧠 What We Completed Today (Short & Clean)

Understood what the Miller effect actually is and where it appears

Analyzed how C<sub>gd</sub> reflects as C<sub>eq</sub> across input

Determined which regions of CE amplifier design are affected

Drew rough signal-flow and small-signal sketches

Solved example CE gain with and without Miller multiplication

Checked bias resistors for stability & operating point shift

Compared re<sub>π</sub>, gm, ro influence on gain

Discussed how increasing bandwidth affects stage design choices
