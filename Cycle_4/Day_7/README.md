## Day Objective
Consolidate all domains studied in Cycle 4 through revision, practice problems, mini projects, and hands-on coding to lock concepts for ECET and core engineering foundations.

---

## Domains Covered

### ECE (Mathematics + Core Concepts)
- Logarithms: properties, equations, applications
- Partial fractions (all ECET standard cases)
- Matrices: operations, determinants, inverse
- Trigonometry: identities, allied angles, compound angles
- Inverse trigonometric functions
- Applications to AC circuits, phase, power factor

### Python Programming
- Variables as references to objects
- Core data types and truthiness
- Arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operators
- String manipulation and formatting
- Input/output and error handling
- Decision-based mini project (“Engineer Mode”)
- Time delays using `time.sleep()`

### Quantum Computing (Intro Coding)
- Concept of qubits vs classical bits
- Quantum coding using Python
- Basic Qiskit circuit:
  - Qubit creation
  - Hadamard gate
  - Measurement
- Understanding probabilistic outputs
- Quantum coding mindset vs classical execution

### VHDL (Hands-on Closure)
- Entity vs architecture
- `std_logic` and `std_logic_vector`
- IEEE `STD_LOGIC_1164`
- Clocked process using `rising_edge`
- Reset logic
- Sequential logic inference (flip-flops)
- Understanding HDL as hardware description, not execution

---

## Key Takeaways
- ECET maths concepts revised and reinforced
- Python used as an engineering decision tool
- Quantum computing introduced without overload
- VHDL coding confidence improved with synthesizable design
- Strong distinction built between:
  - software execution
  - hardware description
  - quantum state manipulation
