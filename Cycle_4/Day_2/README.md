# SID’s Marathon – Cycle 4 Day 2

## Domain
VHDL (RTL Foundations)

## Learning Objective
Understand VHDL fundamentals and write basic synthesizable designs.

## Topics Covered

### Part 1 – Digital Abstraction
- Transistor → Logic Gate → Circuit → RTL abstraction
- Why HDLs exist
- Hardware description vs software programming
- Concurrent nature of hardware

### Part 2 – VHDL Design Structure
- Entity as interface (black box)
- Architecture as implementation
- Separation of interface and behavior
- One entity, multiple possible architectures

### Part 3 – Libraries, Data Types & Ports
- IEEE library usage
- std_logic_1164 standard
- std_logic vs bit
- std_logic_vector as a bus
- Port directions: in, out, inout

### Part 4 – Concurrent Logic & Basic Gates
- Concurrent signal assignment
- AND, OR, NOT, XOR
- Multiplexer using when–else
- Behavioral vs structural modeling
- Introduction to sequential logic using process blocks
- rising_edge(clk) for clocked behavior

### Part 5 – Simulation & Synthesis Awareness
- Simulation vs synthesis distinction
- Role of testbench
- Gate-level representation (conceptual)
- Why HDL is not “executed” like software

## Coding Practice (Synthesizable)
- Multi-input combinational logic block
- 2:1 Multiplexer
- 1-bit clocked register (flip-flop)

## Cross-Links (Minimal)
- ECE: Logic gates & timing behavior
- Quantum: Qubit as vector representation
- Embedded: Digital I/O mapping to logic
- Python: Logic testing as HDL-style simulation
