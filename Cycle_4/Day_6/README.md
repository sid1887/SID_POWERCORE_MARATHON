## Domain
Python Programming

## Theme
Programming Fundamentals & Core Language Concepts

## Learning Objective
Build a strong foundation in Python programming with an engineering mindset, focusing on data handling, operators, safety, and mathematical applications relevant to ECE.

---

## Topics Covered

### Part 1 – Python Philosophy & Variables
- Python design philosophy (readability over cleverness)
- Dynamic typing and runtime type inference
- Variables as names pointing to objects
- Difference between reassignment and mutation

### Part 2 – Core Data Types
- int, float, bool, str, None
- Arbitrary precision integers
- Floating-point precision limitations
- Truthiness rules and type behavior
- Type checking and explicit conversion

### Part 3 – Operators
- Arithmetic operators (/ vs //, %, **)
- Comparison operators and chained comparisons
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>)
- Critical distinction between logical and bitwise operations
- Short-circuit evaluation and safety

### Part 4 – Strings & Formatting
- Strings as immutable sequences
- Indexing and slicing
- Concatenation and repetition
- f-strings for clean output
- Numeric formatting for engineering values
- Strings as debugging and logging tools

### Part 5 – Input / Output & Error Handling
- input() behavior and type conversion
- print() for visibility and debugging
- try/except for safe execution
- Handling ValueError and ZeroDivisionError
- Engineering mindset: fail safely, not silently

---

## Mini Project – AC Signal Analyzer
- Mathematical model of AC voltage
- Use of trigonometric functions (sin, cos)
- Phase angle and power factor calculation
- Radian–degree conversion
- Clean formatted output
- Safe handling of invalid inputs

---

## Cross-Domain Relevance
- Python as a math and simulation tool
- Direct link to trigonometry and AC circuits
- Preparation for NumPy, signal processing, and automation
- Debug mindset transferable to embedded serial logs

---

## Status
✅ Python core concepts completed
✅ Math + Python integration achieved
✅ Engineering-style safe coding practiced
