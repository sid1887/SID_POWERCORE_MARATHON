# 🌐 Cycle 2 – Day 3: Signal Systems & Communication (Fusion-AG Mode)

## 📅 Date
Nov 28, 2025

## 🎯 Focus
A deep yet intuitive session on modern communication concepts:
- Modulation fundamentals (Why modulation exists)
- Baseband vs Passband intuition
- Carrier/message interaction
- Power & bandwidth logic
- QPSK deeper understanding (I/Q plane, phase rotation, constant envelope)
- Introduction to eye diagrams for system integrity
- Logic skill reinforcement (puzzle + digital logic question)

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

### Why Modulation?
- Reduces antenna size dramatically (baseband → antenna would be ~25 km).
- Avoids signal collisions on the same spectrum.
- Higher frequency → better radiation and noise immunity.
- Enables efficient multi-user communication.

### Baseband vs Passband
- Baseband = low-frequency message.
- Passband = baseband shifted around high-frequency carrier by modulation.
- Carrier acts like a “canvas” for painting message variations.

### AM/FM/PM Recap (Intuitive)
- **AM:** height varies → noise-sensitive.
- **FM:** spacing varies → high SNR.
- **PM/PSK:** angle/rotation changes → robust digital modulation.

### QPSK – Deeper Model
- Uses I (cosine) + Q (sine) components.
- Encodes 2 bits per symbol by rotating the phasor to 4 quadrants.
- Constant magnitude → efficient RF power amplification.
- Foundation for 16-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM, OFDM used in 4G/5G/WiFi.

### Eye Diagram Intuition
- Open eye = clear symbol detection.
- Closed eye = noise + ISI → system failing.

### Logic Questions from Today
- Sequence puzzle and Johnson counter concept (see Notion page below).
